"""
Bitwise operators compare or evaluate individual bits within _binary words_
(sequences of binary values).  Unlike Boolean operators, which yield single
True/False values, bitwise operators act on multiple values within a pair
of binary words to yield a new binary word, where each bit in the new sequence
is determined by comparing the corresponding bits in the initial word pair.

Summary of bitwise operators:

x & y    AND
x | y    OR
~x       COMPLEMENT (NOT)
x ^ y    XOR (exclusive OR)
x << n   shift bits left n places (same as multiplying by 2**y)
x >> n   shift bits right n places (same as dividing by 2**y)

print('---------------------------------------')

"""
Our written system for base 10 (decimal) numbers uses 10 digits (0,1,2,...,9) to 
represent the value. To interpret a multi-digit number we learn at an early age to
evaluate each "power of 10" in the number, with the lowest power at the right end
of the number (ones column) and increasing powers going left (tens column, hundreds
column, etc.). By this convention, we interpret a decimal number like 479 as follows:

479 = 4*10^2 + 7*10^1 + 9*10^0
    = 4*100  + 7*10   + 9*1 
    = 400    + 70     + 9

This same convention applies to *any* number base, inluding base 2 (binary). 
For base 2, we only have 2 digits (0 and 1). For example, a binary value of
11010 is interpreted as a base 10 number like this:

110110 = 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0
       = 1*32  + 1*16  + 0*8   + 1*4   + 1*2   + 0*1
       = 54

This approach can be applied to any number base system such as octal (base 8),
hexadecimal (base 16), etc.

# Values of +all+ types are stored in the computer as binary words.
# Thus it is a misnomer to talk about "declaring" a binary value.
# Rather, we want to be able to understand how to create a value
# correspomding to a particular bit sequence.

# The int() function can be used to convert values from different
# number bases to base 10, providing one option for converting between
# binary (base 2) and decimal (base 10). The function has the form:
#
#   int(value_as_string, base)
#
# Example: convert 0101 (base 2) to decimal:
x = int('0101',2)  # 0101 (b2) = 5 (b10)

# We can also directly declare binary values by preceeding a binary
# value with _0b_ as follows:
y = 0b0110         # 0110 (b2) = 6 (b10)

# Displaying either variable using print() will show a base 10 value!
# We cam display a binary word by either using the bin() function, or
# using string formatting:
print(x)                 # --> 5
print(bin(x))            # --> "0b101"
print("{:b}".format(x))  # --> "101"
print(f"{x:b}")          # --> "101"

# Hang on...we defined x as a 4-bit word, but only 3 bits appear in 
# the output.  This is because Python does not keep track of 
# leading zeros. If we know the word length, use string formatting
# to control output appearance:

print(f"{0b1010:04b}")  # format output 4 char long using "0" for padding.

x = 0b0101
y = 0b0110
print(f"x =     { x   :04b}") 
print(f"y =     { y   :04b}")

   |       (Bitwise OR)
   ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=, is, is not, in, not in  (Comparisons, Membership)

# Right bit shifting – extra bits roll off and are forgotten:
x = 0b0101
print(f"(x >> 3) << 3 =   { (x>>3) <<3 :04b}")

# increases to retain MSB):

print('Complement Operator (Bitwise NOT):')
print('---------------------------------------')

# Now try the complement operator (~): 
print(f"x | ~x =          { x | ~x :b}")

# x | ~x = -1 for any x
# 
# or equivalently, if x is an integer:
# 
# ~x = -(x+1) for any x
#
# Thus ~x will always invert the sign of x (when interpreting
# x as an integer).
#
# This result may not be what you were expecting.
# ~x yields "one's complement" of x, meaning each bit
# is flipped **including all leading bits** that determines
# if the value is positive or negative: Python
# represents a positive number with leading '0' values, and a 
# negative numbers with leading '1' values.
#
# Thus one's complement of a positive number will flip the
# leading zeros into leading ones (due to bit inversion),
# thus making the value negative.
#
# To make matters more confusing, values are represented
# by the computer using "two's complement", which is
# defined by taking one's complement (flipping bits) and 
# adding 1.
#
# How does Python know that 11111010 is -6 and not -3 (in other
# words, how does it know that this bit:
#                                |
#                            11111010
# is part of the number and not just a leading 1 indicating a negative
# value)?  In languages such as C++, which have fixed-length 
# binary values, the answer would be that the system has to keep
# track of the number of relevant bits, but this is not the case
# in Python, which uses infinite-precision signed integers, and
# performs bitwise operations on actual integers, with the result
# automatically being a valid Python integer rather than a raw bit
# pattern.

# Here is an example:

print( 0b110)   #  6 base 10
print(~0b110)   # -7 base 10 via two's complement:
                #    flip bits:       001 (one complement)
                #    subtract 1:      000
                #    flip bits again: 111 = 7 (negative)

# Just remember that bitwise NOT flips all bits of a binary word, 
# but the result is interpreted using two's complement. As a result,
# when you +display+ the result using either bin() or string formatting
# it will not appear "correctly" (although it will still work the 
# way you expect "under the hood" when comparing binary words of 
# appropriate length):

print(bool(x & ~x))
print(bool(x | ~x))
print(bool(~0b1111 & 0b1111))



print()
print('Bit Masks:')
print('---------------------------------------')

# How do we get ~ to display the expected result without creating
# a negative value?  Use a bit mask to force a leading "0" bit:

x    = 0b11110000
mask = 0b11111111
print(f"x =         {  x   :08b}")
print(f"~x =        { ~x   :08b}")
print(f"mask =      { mask :08b}")
print(f"~x & mask = { ~x & mask :08b}")

# Same idea, returning to our original example:
print(f'x | (~x & mask) = { x | (~x & mask) :08b}')


"""
Bit Fields
"""

# Bit fields are used to store multiple binary values in our code such
# as system states or flags as individual bits of a binary word. 

# Suppose code is being developed to control a mechatronic device with
# the following 4 boolean flags:
#   bit 0: Power on
#   bit 1: Error
#   bit 2: Overheated
#   bit 3: Battery low

# Create bit masks (using bit shifting) to define which bit
# in the status bit field is associated with each state:
POWER        = 1 << 0  # 0b0001
ERROR        = 1 << 1  # 0b0010
OVERHEATED   = 1 << 2  # 0b0100
BATTERY_LOW  = 1 << 3  # 0b1000

# Initial status: Power ON, Error ON, Battery low ON => 0b1011
status = POWER | ERROR | BATTERY_LOW

# Bitwise AND can be used to check flag status (do you see why 
# this works?):

   print(f'\nCurrent status bit field: {status:04b}')

# Bitwise operators can also be applied to directly modify the flags
# without using any conditionals, and without affecting other status bits. 

# Set a flag (turn flag on):
status |= POWER            # Set power ON
status |= ERROR            # Set error flag ON
check_status()

# Set multiple flags at the same time:
status |= POWER | ERROR # Set both power and error flags
check_status()

# Clear a flag (turn flag off):
status &= ~ERROR           # Clear error flag (turn OFF)
status &= ~POWER           # Clear power flag
check_status()

# Clear Multiple Flags at the same time:
status &= ~(POWER | ERROR)   # Clear both power and error flags
check_status()

# Toggle a flag (flip on/off):
status ^= BATTERY_LOW      # Toggle battery low flag
status ^= POWER            # Toggle power state

# Toggle multiple flags at the same time:
status ^= POWER_ON | BATTERY_LOW
